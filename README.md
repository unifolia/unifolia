Hello! ðŸ’» I'm James and I'm an experienced + proven front-end software engineer in Toronto, Canada. I'm also a musician.

I work with HTML, CSS (SCSS, Tailwind, Styled Coomponents), and JavaScript (TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express). I'm currently digging more into the back-end and am learning Rust (slowly).

I have a cat named Rembrandt and too many guitars. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about any of these things.
